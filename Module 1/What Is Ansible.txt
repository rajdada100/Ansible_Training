---------------------------------------
🎯 Objective
Set up Ansible and understand how to run basic ad-hoc commands.

🔹 1. What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source IT automation engine:

Agentless: No software needs to be installed on managed nodes

Uses SSH to connect to Linux hosts (WinRM for Windows)

Automates configuration, deployments, and orchestration

⚙️ Use Cases:
Provisioning: Set up servers, VMs, cloud instances

Configuration Management: Keep systems in a desired state

App Deployment: Deploy code in a consistent, repeatable way

Orchestration: Coordinate multiple systems (e.g., DB before app)
